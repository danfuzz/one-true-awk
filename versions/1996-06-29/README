This is the version of awk described in "The AWK Programming Language",
by A. V. Aho, B. W. Kernighan, and P. J. Weinberger
(Addison-Wesley, 1988, ISBN 0-201-07981-X).
Changes, mostly bug fixes and occasional enhancements, are listed
in FIXES.  If you distribute this code further, please please please
distribute FIXES with it.  If you find errors, please report them
to bwk@bell-labs.com.  Thanks.

The program itself is created by
	make
which should produce a longish sequence of messages roughly like this:

        yacc -d awkgram.y

conflicts: 43 shift/reduce, 85 reduce/reduce
        mv y.tab.c ytab.c
        mv y.tab.h ytab.h
        cc -O -c ytab.c
        cmp -s ytab.h prevytab.h || (cp ytab.h prevytab.h; echo change maketab)
change maketab
        cc -O -c b.c
        cc -O -c main.c
        cc -O -c parse.c
        cc -O maketab.c -o maketab
        ./maketab >proctab.c
        cc -O -c proctab.c
        cc -O -c tran.c
        cc -O -c lib.c
        cc -O -c run.c
        lex awklex.l
        mv lex.yy.c lexyy.c
        cc -O -c lexyy.c
        cc -O ytab.o lexyy.o b.o main.o parse.o proctab.o tran.o lib.o run.o   -lm

This produces an executable a.out;  you will eventually
want to move this to some place like /usr/bin/awk.

If your system is missing some of the components, e.g., yacc or lex,
you should be able to compile the pieces manually.  We have included
yacc output in ytab.c and ytab.h, and lex output in lexyy.c.

NOTE: This version uses ANSI C, as you should also.

The version of malloc that comes with some systems (e.g., IRIX) is
astonishly slow.  If awk seems slow, you might try fixing that.
