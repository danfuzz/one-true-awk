One True Awk
============

This repo serves as an archive of versions of Awk developed by the
original Awk authors &mdash; (in acronym order) Alfred V. Aho, Peter
Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan &mdash; and most recently primarily
maintained by Kernighan. These versions of Awk are sometimes referred
to as "Bwk" as a tip o' the hat to the fact that Kernighan (whose
middle initial is "W") has been the most active of the authors in
developing this code.

This archive includes the earliest widely published version through
versions released quite recently (as of this writing). The
[versions/](versions) directory has each version in a separate
subdirectory. See that directory's [README](versions/README.md) file
for details about the origin of each version.

The [latest/](latest) directory has a full (as can be
made) git history of all the versions, with tip-of-tree being the
latest version. `git blame` provides useful output on files in
`latest/`.

If you have access to a version of the code not represented in this
repo, then please send mail to me, or just submit a pull request.  In
particular, the earliest version contained herein is from 1979, and
the historical record is missing any versions published in the
following years: 1981 1982 1984 1987 1988 1990 1991 1994 1995
2001 2006 2008

I hope you find this archive educational, entertaining, and enlightening.
Cheers!
